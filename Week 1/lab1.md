## 🧭 Narrative (≈180 words)

The evolution of Artificial Intelligence reflects a journey from **symbolic logic** to **autonomous reasoning**. In the 1950s–1980s, **rule-based systems** (Symbolic AI) relied on hand-crafted knowledge and logic, forming the early foundations of machine reasoning. The 1990s ushered in **statistical machine learning**, emphasizing pattern recognition through algorithms like SVMs and reinforcement learning, enabling machines to learn from data rather than rules. By 2012, **deep learning** revolutionized AI through neural networks and large-scale computation, powering breakthroughs in vision and speech. From 2018 onwards, **Generative AI** (BERT, GPT-3, Stable Diffusion) brought creative and contextual intelligence, enabling text, code, and image generation.  

The transition to **Agentic AI** (2023–present) marks a paradigm shift — AI systems that **act with intent**, **remember context**, **use tools**, and **collaborate**. These agents demonstrate autonomy, long-term memory, reasoning, and planning across multi-agent systems, representing the next frontier where AI evolves from reactive to **proactive intelligence**, capable of sustained, goal-driven interaction in dynamic environments.
